It was December 16, 2023 that I learned that my wife of two years – partner of six – was having an affair. In an instant my world came crumbling down; that feeling followed me into 2024 where I wondered where life would take me now.</p><p>I felt lost, insecure, and was questioning everything. What was I going to do? How could I ever move on? Where do I go?</p><p>I didn’t (and still don’t) have the money to move into an apartment by myself on Long Island where a studio apartment goes for $2,000.00/month which is just over 50% of my monthly take-home income.</p><p>I didn’t (and still don’t) have a remote job, so while friend’s graciously offered me rooms in their homes outside Albany, NY and Houston, TX, that wasn’t an option either.</p><p>So, I went to my parents and asked if I could move back in knowing full well there was not a room available in the house. Thankfully, they agreed to rent a storage unit to store their stuff in so I could claim a 120 sq. ft. bedroom for myself. Note, the storage unit is larger than my bedroom 😂</p><p>That’s a bleak onset of the year, but that’s life. I don’t tell you all of this so for your pity, but so you can see the massive turnaround one event had on me; that event was my first tech conference.</p><h2>Entering the tech community</h2><p>Some quick background: I have been studying web development on and off for several years. I started in late 2018/early 2019 and wandered from frontend web development —&amp;gt; IT Helpdesk work —&amp;gt; cloud engineering —&amp;gt; frontend web development/engineering ♻️. Through the years my discipline would come and go like waves upon a shore. While I joined Twitter (now X) in April 2018, I was not very active and more of a lurker.</p><p>However, in 2023 I won a ticket to attend THAT Conference in Round Rock, TX (outside Austin) which was from January 29, 2024 - January 31. Little did I know how impactful that one event would be.</p><p>I’ve written about <a href="https://ryanfurrer-v5.netlify.app/blog/that-conference/">THAT Conference</a> on my blog before, and The Power of Community on my newsletter, but here is the number one thing THAT Conference did for me:</p><p><strong>It gave me a place where I felt like I <em>belonged</em> once again. I hadn’t felt that since I was in the music education and performance community prior to 2018.</strong></p><p>The people I met at THAT quickly became friends that I now cannot imagine my life without! Not only that but I truly believe that it is only because of these connections I was afforded and was able to succeed in the other opportunities I’ve had this year, including but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Working with <a href="https://www.jamesqquick.com/">James Q. Quick</a> on <a href="https://www.dealsfordevs.com/">Deals for Devs</a></li><li>Working with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashilo/">Shashi Lo</a> on <a href="https://www.gridironsurvivor.com/login">Gridiron Survivor</a></li><li>Taking part in the <a href="https://www.dallassoftwaredevelopers.org/">Dallas Software Developers</a> <a href="https://www.dallassoftwaredevelopers.org/cohorts">cohort</a> led by <a href="https://www.dthompsondev.com/">Danny Thompson</a></li><li>Starting my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ryandotfurrer">Twitch Channel</a></li><li>Starting my podcast, Web Dev Dialogues</li></ul><p>All that to boot, I firmly believe my first job in tech will stem from the connections I have made and continue to make in the community.</p><p>Thank you to everyone that has shown me nothing but kindness, support, friendship, and more through this year. I would not have gotten through this year as well as I did without you all.</p><h2>Leaning into <em>me</em></h2><p>Over the last 5–6 years I’ve started being more comfortable with <em>who I am</em>. That’s not to say I’ve settled and do not want to continue to improve, but instead of trying to be a version of myself others seem to want me to be I am leaning into being the version of myself <em>I want to be</em>.</p><p><strong>In 2024 I leaned even more into this.</strong></p><p>This might be obvious to some but for me it’s only come to light in recent years how much effort I was putting in to be a version of myself to appease others rather than myself. Through self-care including therapy, journaling, and meditation I am finally happy with <em>some</em> of the things I am doing and am celebrating all wins no matter the size . There is of course, room for improvement; for example, my physical health is in rough shape and has been an ongoing struggle for years but that is entirely in my control.</p><h2>Worrying about only what you can control</h2><p>This is an extension of my self-development, but I have really tried my hardest to only worry about only what I can directly control.</p><p>For example, a major push I made this year is making the effort to lift others up. I have been a negative person for many years – living with my parents again makes me see where I got it – and this year I wanted to change that. Guess what? That is something I am in direct control of.</p><p>While you cannot control everything, there is always something you can control in any situation. I cannot control the fact that my ex-wife had an affair; what I <em>can</em> control is how I let it affect me. I can feel the anxiety and emotions, however, I can instead put that energy into what I can do to bounce back from it.</p><p><em>“Remember: You don’t control what happens, you control how you respond.”<br></em>- Ryan Holiday</p><h2>Being selfish</h2><p>Being selfish was always surrounded with a negative connotation in my life, however, I truly believe that if you are not putting yourself first you are doing yourself a disservice.</p><p>There are, of course, circumstances where you cannot; caring for a sick loved one, caring for a newborn, etc. But you cannot assume anyone else will put you first, so you ought to ensure you <em>do it for you</em>.</p><p>This is something I’ve really been trying to do and have both succeeded and failed this year. There are a few friends who know I bit off more than I could chew at times as I did not say “no” enough this year. These are all lessons I am continuing to learn and boundaries I am learning to set.</p><h2>How it ended</h2><p>I’m closing out this year with my head held high and excited for 2025. In an almost poetic manner, I attended another tech conference in the beginning of December; the Commit Your Code Conference (CYC Conference) which took place in Plano, TX (outside of Dallas).</p><p>These conferences that book-ended my year were very similar in vibes but very different in personal execution.</p><p>I went into THAT Conference knowing about 3–5 people in the community. I went into the CYC Conference knowing <em>hundreds</em>.</p><p>I went into THAT Conference feeling alone. I went into the CYC Conference feeling more connected than ever.</p><p>However, I came out of both feeling energized, excited, and thankful.</p><p>At the CYC Conference I had the opportunity to meet legends such as Leon and Quincy Larson, as well as my Dallas Software Developers cohort lead, Yoon! I had people coming up to <em>me</em> recognizing <em>who I was</em> from the community. It was a humbling experience to say the least and I am so thankful to the team that pulled it off: Danny Thompson, Braydon Coyer, Devyn Coyer, Dennis Garcia, and Erik Anderson.</p><p>I don’t say this all to brag, but to point out how one catalyst turned a year I wanted to forget into a year I could <em>never</em> forget.</p><p><strong>If you want to connect, here is where you can find me:</strong></p><p>X/Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/ryandotfurrer">@ryandotfurrer</a></p><p>Bluesky: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryandotfurrer.bsky.social">@ryandotfurrer</a></p><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanfurrer/">@Ryan Furrer</a></p><p>Twitch*: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ryandotfurrer">@ryandotfurrer</a></p><p>*I aim to start streaming weekly again in 2025 because I miss it.</p><p>---</p><h2>Photo dump</h2><p>Here’s a quick photo dump from some things I did this year</p><h3>THAT Conference • January 2024</h3><picture> <source srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z2j0j9ei/production/1642c38ecc3773d8cd15629e025a10db29a0ae0f-1024x768.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"> <img class="responsive__img" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z2j0j9ei/production/1642c38ecc3773d8cd15629e025a10db29a0ae0f-1024x768.png"> </picture><picture> <source srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z2j0j9ei/production/83d2fa2ad3d44bba7283b63989693733c49acc02-1024x768.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"> <img class="responsive__img" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z2j0j9ei/production/83d2fa2ad3d44bba7283b63989693733c49acc02-1024x768.png"> </picture><picture> <source srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z2j0j9ei/production/8e364c0050122114e5144a2a95306af8955b789b-1024x768.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"> <img class="responsive__img" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z2j0j9ei/production/8e364c0050122114e5144a2a95306af8955b789b-1024x768.png"> </picture><h3>Attending an IMSA Race at Watkins Glen • June 2024</h3><picture> <source srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z2j0j9ei/production/67dc41c4f11f2f71630ff69f34918020a7b1102d-1024x768.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"> <img class="responsive__img" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z2j0j9ei/production/67dc41c4f11f2f71630ff69f34918020a7b1102d-1024x768.png"> </picture><p>Met a few friends (middle row) from an online racing league I helped form.</p><picture> <source srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z2j0j9ei/production/bcafd73966d5654fe852621a1a023d8e54d2fbab-1024x768.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"> <img class="responsive__img" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z2j0j9ei/production/bcafd73966d5654fe852621a1a023d8e54d2fbab-1024x768.png"> </picture><p>I also got to spend some extra time with my best friend of ~26 years, Anthony, his wife Kat, and their son (my nephew), Vincent.
