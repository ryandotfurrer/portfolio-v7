      <p>
        I'm Ryan Furrer, a <span class="text-accent">Frontend Engineer</span> who
        cares deeply about the details: how things <span class="text-accent"
          >look</span
        >, how they <span class="text-accent">feel</span>, and whether they're <span
          class="text-accent"
        >
          accessible</span
        > or not. I thrive on small, fast-moving teams where we ship often, iterate
        quickly, and can actually see the impact of our work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe great products come from <span class="text-accent"
          >sweating the details</span
        > and <span class="text-accent">caring about the craft</span>. I'm
        always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not working, you'll probably find me tinkering with side
        projects, writing about what I'm learning, or exploring new tools and
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, if I need some downtime, I'll fire up a game or catch up on whatever
        shows or anime I've been putting off. <a href="/now"
