      <p>
        I'm Ryan Furrer — a Frontend Engineer who cares deeply about the
        details: how something looks, how it feels, and whether it's accessible
        to everyone. I thrive on small, fast-moving teams where we can ship
        often, iterate quickly, and actually see the impact of our work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe great products come from sweating the details and caring about
        the craft. I'm also always looking for new challenges and opportunities
        to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me tinkering with side
        projects, writing about what I'm learning, or exploring new tools and
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, if I need some downtime I'll fire up a game or continue watching of
        the any shows/anime I'm behind on watching.
