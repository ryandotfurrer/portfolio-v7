          I just returned from my first company offsite which took place in
          Portland, OR. It was a long week but great to meet everyone in-person
          and get to know everyone better.
        </p>
        <p>
          During February, I plan to continue my focus on my mental and physical
          health including returning to the gym which I'm excited for. I'm also
          focusing a lot on my finances this year to prepare to move into a new
          apartment next year. The plans are made, now it's up to me to execute.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also excited for a handful of projects I'm working on, one of
          which is a personal dashbaord I can use to track various things like
          my social following, habits, to-dos, and more. Think of it like a
          one-stop-shop for myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          More on that will be shared in the near-ish future on my <a

          Focusing on both my mental and physical health, giving it all at my
          job, and moving into a new apartment next year. I'm setting up the
          systems now to help me stay on track and meet my goals.
