# ryanfurrer.com v7.0.0

As I've grown as a developer, and lately a designer as well, I have been updating my portfolio in roughly a yearly cadence. I really enjoy using my portfolio site as a way to learn, mess with new technologies/tools, and design.

This time around I really aimed or a minimal yet refined look; honestly it's something I've been wanting to design and build for a while and I'm glad I did. I think it came out pretty good! There are changes I will make as the site lives and I add new features, designs, and layouts. Thankfully [Linear](https://linear.app) helps keep track of everything I _want_ to do.

I'll be writing a blog post going more in depth on the why and how I built this latest version; if that sounds interesting to you follow me on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/ryandotfurrer) to see when that is published.
